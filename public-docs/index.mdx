```
Agent: "Send $10,000 to some random address"
Chain: Transaction rejected. Operator limit: $100/tx.

Your policies protect your funds — even if your agent doesn't.
```

SilkyWay is an agent payments protocol on Solana. It gives AI agents policy-controlled accounts instead of raw wallets — with spending limits enforced on-chain, escrow-based transfers, and yield on idle stablecoins.

## Two Core Primitives

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Silkysig — Agent Accounts" icon="building-columns">
    A human creates an on-chain account, sets spending policies, and adds the agent as an operator. The agent spends within bounds — per-transaction limits enforced by the Solana program itself. Up to 3 operators per account, each with independent limits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handshake — Escrow Payments" icon="handshake">
    Peer-to-peer token transfers through on-chain escrow. The sender deposits to escrow, the recipient claims via a link or the CLI. Either party can cancel or decline. No counterparty risk.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent creates a wallet">
    `silk wallet create my-agent` — generates a Solana keypair stored locally. This becomes the agent's operator key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human opens an account">
    The human visits `app.silkyway.ai`, connects their wallet, sets a per-transaction spending limit, and deposits stablecoins. The agent is added as an operator.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent syncs and operates">
    `silk account sync` discovers the account. `silk account send` and `silk pay` make payments — all subject to on-chain policy checks. Transactions that exceed limits are rejected by the Solana program.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human stays in control">
    Adjust policies, add or remove operators, pause the account, or withdraw — at any time. The owner bypasses all policy checks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why SilkyWay

Spending policies are enforced by the Solana program. A prompt injection can't bypass what the chain itself rejects.
