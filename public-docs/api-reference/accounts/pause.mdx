## `POST /api/account/pause`

Builds an unsigned transaction that toggles the pause state of a Silkysig account. When paused, operators cannot make transfers. Only the account owner can toggle pause.

### Request Body

<ParamField body="owner" type="string" required>
  Account owner's Solana wallet address (must be the signer).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="accountPda" type="string" required>
  The Silkysig account PDA.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="transaction" type="string">
  Base64-encoded unsigned Solana transaction. Sign with the owner's key and submit via [`POST /api/tx/submit`](/api-reference/transfers/submit).
</ResponseField>

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.silkyway.ai/api/account/pause \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner": "7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr",
    "accountPda": "9aE5kBqR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4"
  }'
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction": "base64-encoded-unsigned-transaction..."
  }
}
```

### Errors

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `Unauthorized` | Signer is not the account owner |
| `INVALID_PUBKEY` | One of the addresses is not a valid public key |

<Info>
  This is a toggle — if the account is currently active, it will be paused. If already paused, it will be unpaused. The owner can always operate regardless of pause state.
