## `POST /api/tx/submit`

Submits a signed Solana transaction. This is the final step in the [transaction pattern](/api-reference/introduction#transaction-pattern) — after building an unsigned transaction and signing it locally.

### Request Body

<ParamField body="signedTx" type="string" required>
  Base64-encoded signed Solana transaction.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="txid" type="string">
  The Solana transaction signature (base58-encoded).
</ResponseField>

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.silkyway.ai/api/tx/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "signedTx": "base64-encoded-signed-transaction..."
  }'
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "txid": "5UfDuXsr3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4..."
  }
}
```

### Errors

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `MISSING_TX` | `signedTx` field was not provided |
| `TX_FAILED` | Transaction failed on Solana (see message for details) |

<Info>
  If the transaction fails with an on-chain program error, the error message will include the hex error code (e.g., `0x1771`). The SDK maps these to human-readable error codes automatically.
