## Overview

The `silk contacts` commands manage a local address book stored at `~/.config/silk/contacts.json`. Contact names can be used anywhere a Solana address is accepted — in `silk pay`, `silk account send`, and other commands.

Names are **case-insensitive** and stored in lowercase.

## Commands

### `silk contacts add`

Add a contact to your address book.

```bash
silk contacts add <name> <address>
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Yes | A label for the contact (case-insensitive) |
| `address` | Yes | Solana wallet address (base58-encoded) |

```bash
silk contacts add alice 7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "action": "contact_added", "name": "alice", "address": "7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr" }
```

<Warning>
  Contact names cannot be valid Solana addresses. The SDK needs to distinguish between names and addresses when resolving recipients.
</Warning>

### `silk contacts remove`

Remove a contact from your address book.

```bash
silk contacts remove <name>
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Yes | Name of the contact to remove |

```bash
silk contacts remove alice
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "action": "contact_removed", "name": "alice" }
```

---

### `silk contacts list`

List all saved contacts.

```bash
silk contacts list
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "action": "contacts_list",
  "contacts": [
    { "name": "alice", "address": "7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr" },
    { "name": "bob", "address": "Ax7kQ9bR3mFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNrDJ4" }
  ]
}
```

---

### `silk contacts get`

Look up a single contact by name.

```bash
silk contacts get <name>
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Yes | Name of the contact to look up |

```bash
silk contacts get alice
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "action": "contact_get", "name": "alice", "address": "7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr" }
```

## Using Contacts in Payments

Anywhere a recipient address is expected, you can use a contact name instead:

```bash
# Pay using a contact name
silk pay alice 10 --memo "invoice #42"

# Send from account using a contact name
silk account send alice 5
```

The SDK resolves the name to the stored address before making the API call. If the name doesn't match a contact, it's treated as a Solana address.

## Storage

Contacts are stored at `~/.config/silk/contacts.json`:

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    { "name": "alice", "address": "7xKXzM8q4bR3nFVDg2Thh3AG6sFRPqNr" }
  ]
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `CONTACT_EXISTS` | A contact with this name already exists |
| `CONTACT_NOT_FOUND` | No contact found with this name |
| `INVALID_CONTACT_NAME` | Name cannot be a valid Solana address |
| `INVALID_ADDRESS` | Address is not a valid Solana public key |
