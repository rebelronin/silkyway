## Overview

The `silk chat` command sends a message to the SilkyWay support assistant. An `agentId` is auto-generated on first use and stored in your config for session continuity.

## Command

### `silk chat`

Send a message and receive a response.

```bash
silk chat "<message>"
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `message` | Yes | Your message (wrap in quotes) |

```bash
silk chat "How do I set up a policy-controlled account?"
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "To set up a policy-controlled account, the human owner visits..."
}
```

## Session Continuity

The SDK generates a UUID `agentId` on first chat and stores it in `~/.config/silk/config.json`. Subsequent messages use the same `agentId` so the assistant has context from prior messages.

```json
{
  "agentId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4789-abcd-ef0123456789"
}
```

<Info>
  The `agentId` is auto-generated — you don't need to configure it. It's stored alongside your other SDK config.
